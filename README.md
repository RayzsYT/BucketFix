**(!)** For **1.8.8 Spigot** servers only!

## About
**Most 1.8.8 players might have encountered this exact issue many times already.**
<br>
You are playing PvP with a lava bucket in the hand and as soon you rightclick and flick at the same time, your lava splits into two halfs. One half non existant and the another one flowing. 
<br>
<br>
**BucketFix solves this problem so that you do not have to go crazy about it any longer!**

## How does it work?
It sends an update packet each time a player interacts with a lava / water bucket on the ground.
